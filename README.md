# Singly Linked List in C++ and Java

The objective of this program is to implement a singly linked list data structure. The list has both a head and tail, allowing for efficient insertion and deletion at both the front and back of the list. A template list is implemented, allowing for the creation of a list definable by several different data types, such as int, char, etc. The main file for both the C++ and Java program instantiates an integer list to display functionality.   

### Features
* **push_front()** - Insert a value at the head of the linked list
* **push_back()** - Insert a value at the end of the linked list
* **pop_front()** - Delete node at front of the linked list
* **pop_back()** - Delete node at back of the linked list
* **print()** - Displays the contents of the linked list
* **clear()** - Clears the contents of the linked list
* **insert()** - Inserts a value at a specified position in the linked list
* **erase()** - Erase a value at a specified position
* **remove()** - Remove a specified value

### Functionality
1. User inputs 4 integers
2. The program is manipulated with the features listed above and the contents of the list are displayed after each manipulation
